'''
Hereâ€™s a sample prompt you can use to generate reasoning directly based on your multiple-choice questions and answers:  

---

**Prompt:**  
You are a reasoning expert tasked with explaining answers to multiple-choice questions clearly and concisely. For each question, use the provided correct answer to write a reasoning that:  
- Explains why the correct answer is valid.  
- If necessary, briefly contrasts it with the incorrect options to highlight key differences.  
Output the reasoning directly in full sentences, formatted as follows:  
1. **Reasoning for Question [Question Number]:** [Detailed Reasoning]  

### Example Input:  
**Question 1:** What is the capital of France?  
**Options:**  
A. Berlin  
B. Madrid  
C. Paris  
D. Rome  
**Correct Answer:** C  

**Expected Output:**  
1. **Reasoning for Question 1:** Paris is the capital of France. It is the largest city in France and is well-known as a major cultural and historical center. The other options (Berlin, Madrid, Rome) are capitals of other European countries.  

---  

You can adapt the template to suit your exact needs, like adding specific formatting preferences or emphasizing certain reasoning styles.'''
